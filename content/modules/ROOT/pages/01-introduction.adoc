This lab is composed of two hosts.

[arabic]
. controlnode
. rhel1

In this lab, we will use the host `+controlnode+` as the "`control
node`" or the node where we will install and run the firewall system
role. Firewall changes will be applied to `+rhel1+`.

We’ll perform the following 3 tasks.

[arabic]
. We will use the firewall system role to open the appropriate port to
access web servers on `+rhel1+`. This exercise is to show how to open
firewall ports by service.
. As well, we will also use the firewall system role to open port 9999
on `+rhel1+` to enable inbound tcp connections. This exercise is to show
how to open an arbitrary firewall port.
. Finally, we’ll configure port forwarding from 9999 to port 12345 on
`+rhel1+`.
