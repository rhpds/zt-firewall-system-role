== Reset the firewall configuration on rhel1.lab

The firewall system role can reset all settings to the default
configuration found immediately after Red Hat Enterprise Linux is
installed.

We’ll reset the firewall configuration in the `+rhel1+` host.

First, in the `rhel1` terminal, list the current rules.

[source,bash,run]
----
firewall-cmd --list-all
----

In the `controlnode` terminal, we’ll create a new host file called
`+reset+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a /root/reset << EOF
all:
  hosts:
    rhel1:
  vars:
    firewall:
      - previous: replaced
EOF
----

From the `controlnode` terminal, run the playbook to reset the firewall
rules on the `+rhel1+` host.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i reset -b firewall.yml
----

.ansible-playbook -i reset -b firewall.yml - Reset the firewall rules on rhel1

When the playbook as stopped running, switch to the `rhel1` terminal and
check that the firewall rules have been reset.

[source,bash,run]
----
firewall-cmd --list-all
----

If you want to apply the rules we created in the previous steps of this
lab, simply run `+ansible-playbook -i hosts -b firewall.yml+` again.
