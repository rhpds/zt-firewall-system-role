== Forward incoming tcp requests to rhel1 on port 9999 to 12345

In this challenge weâ€™ll forward incoming tcp requests to rhel1 on port
9999 to 12345.

In the `controlnode` terminal, add the lines
`+- forward_port: '9999/tcp;12345;'+` and `+state: enabled+`.

The following command will add those lines for you.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a /root/hosts << EOF
      - forward_port: '9999/tcp;12345;'
        state: enabled
EOF
----

Now run the playbook in the `controlnode` terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts -b firewall.yml
----

In the `rhel1` terminal, run `+nc+`, listening on port 12345.

[source,bash,run]
----
nc -l 12345
----

In the `controlnode` terminal, run `+nc+` and
then type some stuff.

[source,bash,run]
----
nc rhel1 9999
----

Here we are connecting to the `+rhel1+` host on port `+9999+`.

.nc rhel1 9999 - Connecting to port 9999 on rhel1

Here we are listening on port `+12345+`.

.nc 12345 - Listening on port 12345 on rhel1

We can see that the text we typed in the `controlnode` terminal was
printed out in the `rhel1` terminal.

Type `+ctrl-c+` to exit `+nc+`.
