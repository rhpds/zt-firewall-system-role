== Open Arbitrary Port on rhel1.lab

In this challenge weâ€™ll open port 9999 on `+rhel1+`.

In the `controlnode` terminal, add the lines `+- port: ['9999/tcp']+` and
`+state: enabled+` to the `+hosts+` file.

The following command will add those lines for you.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a /root/hosts << EOF
      - port: ['9999/tcp']
        state: enabled
EOF
----

Now run the playbook in the `controlnode` terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts -b firewall.yml
----

.ansible-playbook -i hosts -b firewall.yml - Apply the system role to rhel1

In the `rhel1` terminal, run `+nc+`, listening on port 9999.

[source,bash,run]
----
nc -l 9999
----

In the `controlnode` terminal, run `+nc+` and
then type some stuff.

[source,bash,run]
----
nc rhel1 9999
----

Here we are connecting to the `+rhel1+` host on port `+9999+`.

.nc rhel1 9999 - Test

Here we are listening on port `+9999+`.

.nc listening on port 9999

In the image above the phrase was typed:
`+test+` followed by the
`+enter+` key.

In the `controlnode` terminal, type `+ctrl-c+` to exit `+nc+`.
